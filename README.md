# Microsoft Azure Projects - Deploying a Scalable Web Application Using Azure App Service. (Compute)

*Overview*
The main objective of this project is to deploy a scalable web application on Azure App Service, showcasing how to leverage Azure's platform to host, manage and auto-scale applications efficiently. It aims to create an App Service Plan, deploying a web app and configuring scaling rules to handle varying workloads, ensuring optimal performance and cost-effectiveness.

The steps include:

Log in to Azure Portal: Access Azure services with a Microsoft account.
Create an App Service Plan: Set up an App Service Plan with a free-tier subscription, select a runtime stack (Node.js, Python, .NET, etc.), and choosing a region.
Deploy Your Application: Using GitHub Actions 
Configure Auto-Scaling: Set scaling rules to manage instances based on CPU usage.
Verify Deployment: Access the live application via the default domain URL.

This guide simplifies deploying, managing and scaling a web application in the cloud using Microsoft Azure platform.

###Example###:
A developer is tasked with creating a lightweight e-commerce site for a small business. The site will showcase products, handle customer inquiries and support basic user interactions.

Why Use Azure App Service?

Scalability: The site might experience traffic spikes during sales or promotions, requiring the app to scale dynamically.
Ease of Deployment: Using GitHub Actions or manual deployment, the developer can quickly push updates and bug fixes.
Cost Efficiency: By starting with the free tier and enabling scaling only when necessary, the small business can manage operational costs effectively.
Reliability: Azure App Service ensures high availability and global reach, which is critical for customer satisfaction.
By following this project, the developer can deploy the e-commerce site, ensure it handles real-world demands, and provide a seamless experience to customers without worrying about infrastructure management.
